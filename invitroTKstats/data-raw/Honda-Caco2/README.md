# Honda-Caco2 file descriptions 

Descriptions of files found within invitroTKstats/data-raw/Honda-Caco2. 

The unprocessed data files \insertCite{honda2025impact}{invitroTKstats} are used to generate the readily available example Caco-2 datasets which can be accessed with `data("Caco2-example")`. The example Caco-2 datasets are also used in the function examples for various functions such as `format_caco2` and `calc_caco2_point`. 

The processed data file is an artifact from generating the data and was used to verify output results. 

### Unprocessed data 
The raw data files contains mass spectrometry measurements of membrane permeability (P~app~) from Caco2 cells. The experiments were led by Cyprotex. 

  * Caco2.xlsx - Raw data file containing chemical ID mappings
